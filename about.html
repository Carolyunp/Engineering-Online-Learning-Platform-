        <h1>About This Website</h1>
        <p>Welcome to the Finite Element Method (FEM) learning platform! This website is designed to help students understand and master the concepts of FEM, with a particular focus on Topic 2. The website offers a range of resources, including theory explanations, interactive simulations, walkthrough questions, quizzes, and exam-style questions.</p>
        
        <h2>How to Use This Website</h2>
        <p>To get the most out of this website, follow these steps:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Start with the <strong>Theory</strong> section to familiarize yourself with the core concepts.</li>
            <li>Use the <strong>Interactive Simulations</strong> to experiment and deepen your understanding.</li>
            <li>Proceed to the <strong>Walkthrough Questions</strong> to apply what you've learned with guided examples.</li>
            <li>Test your knowledge with the <strong>Quiz Yourself</strong> section.</li>
            <li>Finally, challenge yourself with the <strong>Exam Questions</strong> to ensure you're exam-ready.</li>
            <li>To take it to the extra mile attempt some <strong>Take it Further</strong> questions to solidify your knowledge.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Inspiration</h2>
        <p>This website was inspired by my individual project. My goal was to create a comprehensive and interactive learning tool that addresses the challenges students face when learning FEM. I hope you find it helpful and engaging.</p>
